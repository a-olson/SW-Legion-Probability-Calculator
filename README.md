# SW-Legion-Probability-Calculator
An attack probability calculator for Star Wars: Legion, a tabletop game by FFG.

This program simulates the steps of an attack thousands of times.
The results of the simulations are recorded and the probability of each outcome is then reported to the user.
As this program is simulating actual dice rolls the exact results will vary each time the simulation in run.
Increasing the number of itterations will increase the accuracy of the results but will also require more computational time.
